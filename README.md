# TheOneYouFeed
A 3D game made using Unity and assets from free Unity store and other free sources. This was created for learning purposes and not meant for commericial means. See credits page for more information.

In TheOneYouFeed you take the role of a forest animal exploring it's environment as it interacts with other creature types and learns to deal with life choices. 
You with be confronted with different scenarios as you continue your journey which will affect how your animal develops and ultimately whom they become overall at the end of their journey. 

This game is inspired by an old story told by a Cherokee Indian chief that was teaching his grandson about life.

He said, "A fight is going on inside me," he told the young boy, "a fight between two wolves.

The Dark one is evil - he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego." He continued, 
"The Light Wolf is good - he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith. 
The same fight is going on inside you grandson… and inside of every other person on the face of this earth.”

The grandson ponders this for a moment and then asked, "Grandfather, which wolf will win?"

The old Cherokee smiled and simply said, "The one you feed".

There are Three endings to this game: Dark Wolf, Light Wolf, and Secret.


UPDATE please read: this is an old repo. I had to remake my directory due to my .gitignore not working correctly so it was uploading files that shouldn't be on GitHub causing many issues/conflicts. Please continue to follow progress on repo called TOYF. Thank you for your support as I continue to learn Unity and expore all it has to offer to make amazing games ~ Developer on 6/22/24 at 9:26 am
